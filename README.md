# OCT
Optimal classification trees


Here the code and experiments are presented based on the formulation in "Bertsimas, D., \& Dunn, J. (2017). Optimal classification trees. Machine Learning, 106(7), 1039â€“1082." with some changes in formulation of MIO. Also the tree was constructed for interpretability of the results.

Code is presented along with experiments on Wine data set.

`OCT.py` contains class `InterpretableClusteringOptimalTree` and function `tree_picture`.
`experiment.ipynb` contains example how to use the class on Wine data set.
